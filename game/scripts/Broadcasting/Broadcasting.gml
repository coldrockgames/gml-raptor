/*
	Message Broadcasting subsystem.
	Part of gml-raptor.
	
	This subsystem consists of three main components:
	- The "Sender": This is your main object.
					The Sender is kind of a radio-station, 
					sending out broadcasts to all listening receivers.
					Just create a new Sender() and add receivers to it.
					NOTE: gml-raptor creates one Sender per Room in the ROOMCONTROLLER
					object. You can use it by adding receivers to ROOMCONTROLLER.Sender
					
	- The "Receiver":	When using the add_receiver function of your sender, a receiver 
						is built with the given name, message_filter and callback.
						Use remove_receiver with its name to stop receiving messages in its callback.
						
	- The "Broadcast":	Use the send function on a sender to send out a broadcast message.
						It contains three members:
						from  - the sender of the broadcast
						title - the name of the broadcast (this one must pass the message_filter of a receiver)
						data  - optional struct that holds any additional data for this broadcast.
						
	How to use the subsystem:
	If you want to send something, just create a new Broadcast(...) and call Sender.send(broadcast).
	
	Here is a small example:
	var snd = new Sender();
	snd.add_receiver("achievement_counter", "*_died", my_achievement_counter_function);
	
	... when a monster dies you could invoke
	snd.send(self, "dragon_died");
		
	You may return "true" from your callback function if it shall be removed from the queue after
	processing the callback. This is a comfortable way to take a receiver out, when its work is done.
