### VERSION LIST
You need [![gmlogo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19487451/177008359-37a3cdb7-2068-4ac8-84ef-4c455c2194de.png)](https://gamemaker.io)&nbsp;&nbsp;Studio 2.3+ to use `raptor`.<br/>
These versions of external libraries are packaged into the current `raptor` release:

| GMS Version | Scribble | SNAP | Canvas |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|2413.1|9.3.5|7.0.1|2.2|

### HOW RELEASES ARE ORGANIZED
* Find the latest release at the [Releases](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor/releases) page
* Downloadable items of a release are:
  * The raptor _project template_ (see the [wiki](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor/wiki) for instructions how use templates in GameMaker)
  * A local package containing the entire raptor with all libraries as `.yymps` file, if you don't like project templates
  * Since `Release 3.0`, a `room-template` package
  * Since `Release 3.0`, a `html-room-template` package

> [!NOTE]
> The room template packages help you speed up your development and have been added to make room creation with all the default layers and objects of raptor easier, by simply importing a package with one single room + room controller and just renaming them!


### CONTRIBUTING
I am happy, if you want to support `raptor` to become even better, just launch a pull request, explain me your changes, and I make sure, you get credited as contributor.
If you have questions, feedback or just want to discuss specific parts of this platform, just open a new thread in the [discussions](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor/discussions) for this repository. I'll do my best to answer any questions as quick as possible!
Feel free to fork, advance, fix and do what you want with the code in this repository, but please respect the MIT License and credit.<br/>


### OTHER LIBRARIES
My main goal is to provide a ready-to-use project template. I am not a big friend of "oh, yes, this is the classes, but you need to download this from here and that other thing from there and make sure, you apply this and this and this setting and best do a npm xy to have this running..." what a mess!
I do not like that. You will always find a single-download-and-run release in the template.

That being said, it leads to this requirement/fact:<br/>
`raptor` contains some other libraries that are referenced from my classes, so they are packaged together with this project template.

Some of these 'other libraries' are my own and are by default also included in the package, because I find it more easy to remove one not required folder by a simple hit of the 'Delete' key instead of browsing the file system for all bread crumbs that need to be added. It just saves time.

By default, these libraries of mine are included:

* [Outline Shader Drawer](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-outline-shader-drawer)
* [Animated Flag](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-animated-flag)
* [HighScorer](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-highscorer)

### CREDITS

Very special thanks to `Alex` [@pamims](https://github.com/pamims) for proof reading my version of the english language and correcting it to the _real_ version of the english language! Thank you very much for volunteering here!


### Credits for external libraries go to
